# Youtube-Downloader-GUI
An advanced YouTube Video and Playlist Downloader using Python3 and Tkinter

First, download and install the latest version of Python 3 in your computer or laptop. We are going to use “pytube” which is a python library. Pytube is a very useful dependency-free library used to download videos from the web.

The best way to install the library is by using pip or conda. PIP comes pre-installed with Python 3.4 or greater versions. If you don’t have pip installed, you can download and install pip from this site (https://www.localtechies.tech/2020/10/what-is-pip-getting-started-with-python.html).
To check the version of pip installed in your computer, open command prompt and type the following command - pip --version then press enter.
